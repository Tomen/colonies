# Definition of Done

The following checklist must pass for every implementation step before it can be considered complete.

- [ ] **Tests:** `npm test` passes with coverage for new functionality.
- [ ] **Lint:** `npm run lint` reports no warnings or errors.
- [ ] **Architecture Docs:** Relevant sections in [`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md) updated.
- [ ] **Implementation Docs:** Step plan marked complete in [`docs/roadmap.md`](roadmap.md).
- [ ] **Acceptance Criteria:** All items in the step's plan are verified.
- [ ] **Peer Review:** Code reviewed and approved.

Each step document links back to this checklist so LLM agents can consistently verify their work.
