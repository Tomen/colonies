# AGENTS

This repository welcomes contributions from LLM agents. Please follow these rules when making changes:

1. Work sequentially through the steps in `docs/steps/` and record progress in `docs/master_checklist.md`.
2. For every change, satisfy the Definition of Done in `docs/definition_of_done.md`.
3. Run `npm test` and `npm run lint` after modifications, capturing and reporting their output even if they fail.
4. Update architecture or design docs in `docs/` whenever functionality or plans change.
5. Use one focused commit per change and do not amend existing history.
6. In summaries, cite files and terminal output with line numbers.
