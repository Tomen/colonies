I want you to review this page and the related explainers and source code: https://www.redblobgames.com/maps/mapgen4/

I want to develop a simulation of the colonization of the American East Coast. The idea is to start with colonies that consist of houses. There is farmable land and plots of land can be claimed and transformed into farmland or manufactures or other things.

I want to create a high-level design for that simulation/game. The focus should be how colonies develop over time. How streets and cities form, harbors, how land gets shaped, how farms develop, forrests are used and reshaped, rivers are crossed with bridges, etc... industries using natural resources...

And the mental visual perspective of how I look at this is sort of as a 2D or 2.5D map that is maybe drawn or like a classical map. and experiencing the flow of time and how cities grow, colonies connect, lands get plotted, cities connected, states form...

Below is a high‑level design for a 2D / 2.5D time‑lapse simulation of settlement on the American East Coast, built on top of the ideas, data structures, and code patterns from Red Blob Games’ mapgen4. I’ll point out where you can lean directly on mapgen4’s dual‑mesh world representation, rainfall & river generation, and rendering/worker architecture, and then layer the colony/land‑use/transport growth model on top.

0) One‑paragraph vision

Generate a coastline + hydrology reminiscent of the American East Coast, then let time flow. Households form early colonies around sheltered harbors and river mouths, claim irregular parcels (metes‑and‑bounds), clear forests for farms, and establish tracks → roads → bridges → towns → cities. Rivers and the fall line (head‑of‑navigation) gate where mills, inland towns, and later industry concentrate. The experience is a drawn/engraved classical map that animates growth: parcels appear, roads braid together, bridges span rivers, harbors deepen, and administrative counties/states coalesce.

1) World substrate (use mapgen4 + light customizations)

a) Geometry & grids — Use mapgen4’s dual mesh (Voronoi regions + Delaunay triangles with half‑edges) as the simulation grid. It gives you natural adjacency for rivers, coasts, parcels, and roads, and it already comes with ergonomic names & “ghost elements” in the v3 dual‑mesh library. 
simblob.blogspot.com
redblobgames.github.io
redblobgames.com

b) Elevation, wind, rainfall, rivers — Keep mapgen4’s evaporation/wind/rainfall model and its river & flow accumulation assignment; these fields will drive farm suitability, forest regrowth, and mill/industry placement. (You get biomes + rivers “for free” while painting terrain.) 
redblobgames.com

c) Coastline profile for an East‑Coast feel — Bias generator parameters to produce:

A long coastal plain, a single mountain belt (Appalachian analog) inland, and many west→east rivers.

A detected fall line where slope rises from the plain to the piedmont; use this as the historic “head‑of‑navigation” line and early mill belt. 
Wikipedia
Encyclopedia Britannica

d) Harbor detector — On coastal regions, score candidate harbor sites by (i) sheltered water (concavity & coastline curvature), (ii) depth just offshore, and (iii) room to turn. Seed ports there. 
National Geographic Education

Implementation note: Mapgen4 splits “algorithms in a worker” (elevation/rainfall/rivers) and rendering; its code is straight TypeScript with files like map.ts (assignElevation/Rainfall/Rivers), mesh.ts (dual mesh), and geometry.ts. You can keep that separation and build your sim loop atop the region/triangle graph. 
GitHub
redblobgames.com

2) Core simulation entities

Region (r): base land/water cell from the dual mesh; persistent fields: elevation, slope, moisture, flow, soil fertility, land‑use, forest age, ownership, buildings. 
redblobgames.github.io

Side (s): half‑edge between regions; stores road segment state, bridge/ferry presence, width/quality, usage counters. 
redblobgames.github.io

Triangle (t): useful for hydrology/geom; can store stream channel geometry for crossings. 
simblob.blogspot.com

Parcel: a polygon overlay (planar subdivision constrained to region borders) representing a claimed plot (irregular metes‑and‑bounds in the colonies). 
FamilySearch

Settlement node: hamlet/town/city; lives on a region; aggregates population, services, and industry slots; acts as network nodes for trade/pathfinding.

Port/Harbor: a settlement with water access + harbor score.

Household/Enterprise agents (coarse): optional light agents that make local decisions (claim, clear, build, upgrade).

Administrative units: colony/county/state polygons forming over time.

3) Time & update loop

Use discrete monthly or seasonal ticks (quarters are fine). Each tick:

Demography: in‑migration, births, deaths; population follows accessibility (travel time to nearest port/town), resource pull (fertility/forest), and safety.

Land use: parcels are claimed/merged/split, forest is cleared, fields are planted, fallowed, or converted to pasture/manufacture.

Production & trade: farms → grain/tobacco/etc.; forests → logs → lumber/charcoal; ore → pig iron → tools; water power boosts mills at falls/rapids; goods routed along the network.

Network growth: usage accumulates on sides; edges upgrade (track→road→turnpike), bridges appear at traffic‑weighted low‑cost river crossings; ferries may precede bridges.

Urbanization: intersections & ports densify; hamlet→town→city thresholds; service unlocks (markets, shipyards, banks).

Governance: boundaries coalesce; county seats often appear near fall line crossings; later, states consolidate. 
Wikipedia

4) Rules of place‑making (how things appear where they do)

A) Parcel claiming (metes‑and‑bounds)

Anchor new parcels on features: a coastline, riverbank, or road segment; choose a bearing+distance sequence (with noise) to grow an irregular polygon that respects obstacles and existing surveys.

Prioritize fertility + moisture + access to water/roads; early parcels elongate along river frontage; later parcels pivot around roads.

If your timeline extends westward, introduce rectangular PLSS as an alternative (outside initial East Coast scope). 
FamilySearch
Wikipedia

B) Road formation (desire‑lines → roads)

Maintain a graph on region adjacency (or sides). Agents send trips; trips follow A* or Dijkstra on a cost field that blends slope, land cover, fords/bridges, and private parcels (tolls). Accumulated usage upgrades the path into a visible road (hysteresis to avoid flicker). 
redblobgames.com

Aesthetics: draw roads as curved paths between cell‑edge attachment points to achieve a classical map look. 
redblobgames.com

Bridges & fords: precompute candidate crossing sites from triangle/river geometry (narrow channels, low flow, stable banks). Promote ford→bridge when volume crosses a threshold and local timber/stone supply is sufficient.

C) Ports/harbors & coastal towns

Spawn first settlements at sheltered/deep harbors and river mouths; score with harbor detector (Section 1d). 
National Geographic Education

D) Fall‑line towns & mills

Detect each river’s head‑of‑navigation by looking for a sharp slope/jump in flow energy near the coastal plain boundary; seed towns/mills here (historic pattern). 
Encyclopedia Britannica
Wikipedia

E) Industry placement

Water‑powered mills at falls/rapids (near fall line).

Lumber/shipyards near timber + harbors.

Ironworks where charcoal timber + bog iron/ore + water power coincide (abstract the geology if you don’t model ore).

Production chains are simple graphs; route outputs to demand via the network (see “trade routes” simulation references on region/dual graphs). 
redblobgames.com

F) Forest dynamics

Forest = age‑structured cover on regions. Clearing yields timber; fallow → regrowth with rainfall/soil modifiers. Over‑extraction raises transport cost (go farther for wood), encouraging roads deeper inland.

5) Data & metrics (what you store and analyze)

Per region: land‑use (forest, field, pasture, manufactory, town), fertility, moisture, forest age, ownership id, parcel id(s), attractiveness score, urban density.

Per side (edge): surface type (track/road/turnpike), width, quality, ferry/bridge flag, usage counters (by commodity/people), maintenance debt.

Per settlement: population, services, industries, port throughput, centrality (betweenness/closeness) to predict where growth should go next.

Global: shipped tonnage, average farm yield, travel times between key nodes, forest cover %, number of bridges, coastline utilization, inequality of land holdings.

6) Algorithms (sketches)

Harbor score H(r) for coastal region r: weighted sum of (shoreline concavity / exposure penalty), (near‑shore depth), (fetch shelter), (siltation risk from river flow). Seed a port if H(r) is a local maximum over neighborhood N. 
National Geographic Education

Fall line detector: for each river trunk, sample cumulative distance from coast; compute dslope/dx (or change in stream power ρ g Q S); mark first exceedance above threshold as head of navigation; place a fall‑line town there. 
Encyclopedia Britannica
Wikipedia

Bridging: precompute candidate crossings (s) where channel width is low and banks are high; define crossing cost = (foundation difficulty from triangle slopes) + (span length) + (flood risk); when rolling 12‑month traffic across that river pair exceeds C(s) * material_availability, build bridge; before that, enable ferries at lower threshold.

Parcel growth (metes‑and‑bounds): starting from an anchor (harbor/road/river bend), pick turning angles and lengths according to local constraints (terrain, existing parcels), snap edges to mesh sides to avoid sliver polygons; ensure closure without self‑intersection; resolve overlaps via local line‑segment diffusion. 
FamilySearch

Pathfinding & network upgrade: route shipments with A* on the region graph (cost = base travel cost + land‑use penalties + tolls + crossing penalties). Tally flows per side and commodity; apply capacity/quality thresholds to upgrade/downgrade edges over multi‑year windows (hysteresis). See Red Blob’s graph/pathfinding intro for the underlying patterns; also look at Amit’s mapgen4 trade route experiments over the dual graph. 
redblobgames.com

7) Urban growth model

Seeds: harbors & fall‑line nodes.

Attractiveness A(r) combines (market access via shortest‑path to ports and administrative seats), (water access), (flat buildable land), and (local services).

Growth rule: population for region r grows by ΔP = f(A(r), jobs, food surplus); when a node’s population crosses thresholds, unlock market, wharf, mill, shipyard, etc. Clusters (intersections + port adjacency) merge into cities, pushing street grids (procedural but loosely aligned with road vectors).

8) Visual design (classical map feel)

Base: keep mapgen4 shader look (soft terrain, painted mountains). 
redblobgames.com

Roads: draw curvilinear edges between side centers; dotted for trails, solid for roads, bold for turnpikes; label milestones. 
redblobgames.com

Parcels: faint tan parcel lines with bearings annotated occasionally (metes‑and‑bounds flavor). 
FamilySearch

Harbors & ports: anchor symbols; soundings/blue tints around ports.

Time‑lapse: a scrubber from year N→M; parcels fade in, roads “grow” from endpoints, bridges build with a little construction animation; boundaries hatch as colonies/states form.

UI layering: follow Red Blob’s “layers” pattern (separate data layers from draw layers; small classes, public fields; minimal ceremony) for performance and clarity. 
redblobgames.com

9) Phased timeline (tech & behaviors)

Early colonial phase: coastal harbors, small parcels hugging rivers, tracks & fords only; heavy dependence on water transport.

Expansion phase: clearing accelerates; fall‑line towns & mills; ferries and the first timber bridges; turnpike segments between major nodes. 
Wikipedia

Proto‑industrial phase (optional): canals/rail (if you extend timeline), larger manufactories near ports and falls; denser street networks.

(You can keep the historical flavor without simulating specific wars/politics; focus on geography‑driven emergence.)

10) Tuning knobs & difficulty

Terrain knobs (ridge orientation, river density, storminess/rainfall), harbor strictness, farm fertility variance, forest regrowth rate, bridge cost multipliers, technology arrival timings, governance consolidation speed, migration rates.

11) Implementation outline (leveraging mapgen4)

World gen: keep mapgen4’s assignElevation/Rainfall/Rivers and dual‑mesh data; add derived layers (slope, fertility, harbor score, fall line). 
redblobgames.com

Overlays: parcel DCEL over region sides; road network on sides; settlements on regions. 
redblobgames.github.io

Sim loop: worker thread updates (demography, land use, trade, network), main thread renders layers. (Mapgen4 already demonstrates worker+renderer separation.) 
redblobgames.com

Pathfinding: A* over region graph for shipments and migrants (precompute heuristics; cache multi‑commodity flows). 
redblobgames.com

UI: map tools for “nudge terrain” (just like mapgen4’s painting) so you can sculpt an East‑Coast‑like seed and immediately see new rivers/biomes. 
redblobgames.com

12) Validation & emergent‑pattern checks

Ports primarily at sheltered harbors and river mouths; inland towns clustering near fall line crossings; bridges at narrowings; road network thickest between port pairs with high flow; parcel angles irregular near coast/streams (metes‑and‑bounds); increasing travel‑time centrality in cities that historically would prosper under similar constraints. 
National Geographic Education
Wikipedia
FamilySearch

13) Nice‑to‑have extensions

Canals as low‑slope river alternatives during a mid‑timeline window.

Seasonality: river fordability and overland cost vary by season.

Vegetation zones (marsh/estuary/salt meadow) influence port siting and disease risk.

Civic improvements: lighthouses, breakwaters, dredging (modify harbor score over time).

Scenario editor: save/load seeds + parcel overlays (mapgen4’s serialization shows how to store points/mesh). 
GitHub

Why mapgen4 is the right substrate

It gives you interactive terrain painting with instant recomputation of rainfall/biomes/rivers, so you can “shape” your Atlantic seaboard until it feels right. 
redblobgames.com

The dual mesh is a perfect backbone for rivers, roads, parcels, and trade graphs — with half‑edges for crossings and a clean index scheme (regions/sides/triangles). 
redblobgames.github.io

Amit’s articles show how to layer graphs & pathfinding and even “trade route” path simulations on the same structure, which is exactly what a colony/industry network needs.

If you’d like, I can turn this into a lightweight milestone plan (prototype world gen + harbor/fall‑line detectors → parcel claiming → desire‑line roads/bridges → trade & town growth) and a minimal TypeScript scaffolding that plugs into the mapgen4 repo layout.

Great—if we’re building this from scratch (no external mapgen code), here’s a complete blueprint of what needs to be built: the runtime, data models, algorithms, visuals, tools, and the order to assemble them. I’ve focused on clear module boundaries, inputs/outputs, and acceptance criteria so you can implement in phases.

0) One‑screen summary

Goal: A 2D/2.5D, time‑lapse simulation of settlement on a stylized American East Coast: parcels are claimed, forests cleared, farms & manufactures appear, paths → roads → bridges → towns → cities; ports flourish; states coalesce.
Approach: Fresh engine with three stacked layers:

Physical layer (heightfield + water + soils + vegetation).

Cadastral layer (parcel & ownership polygons aligned to rivers/roads or bearings).

Network layer (ports, crossings, roads, ferries; costs & usage).

Agents and rules evolve those layers through time. Rendering is cartographic (“classical map”) with a time scrubber.

1) Platform & architecture

Language/stack options (pick one early):

TypeScript + WebGL2/WebGPU: runs in browser; great for interactive tools and shareable builds.

Rust + WASM: robust performance; render via WebGL/WebGPU front‑end; sim in Rust.

C#/C++ desktop: if you prefer native tooling; similar module boundaries.

Core architecture:

ECS (Entity–Component–System) or modular OOP with immutable snapshots for save/load.

Deterministic RNG with seed; versioned save files.

Job system (thread pool or Web Workers) for long‑running steps: river solve, path caches, sim ticks.

Data‑driven config (TOML/JSON) for growth rules, goods, thresholds.

Instrumentation: profiling hooks + overlay stats.

Acceptance criteria:

Same seed + same config ⇒ byte‑identical world & tick results.

Hot‑reload of configs without rebuilding.

2) World representation (Physical layer)

A) Heightfield (H):

Build a procedural terrain pipeline that can produce: long coastal plain, one interior ridge belt, many east‑flowing rivers.

Sources: multi‑octave noise + ridge functions + plate‑like macroscale shaping. Expose knobs for “coastal plain width”, “ridge orientation”, “river density”.

Resolution target: ~2048² height samples (or tiled).

B) Hydrology:

Flow direction from H (D8/D∞); flow accumulation; river graph extraction (nodes at confluences; edges as polylines).

Lake/estuary filling; sea level & tidal estuaries.

Derived fields: slope S, stream power proxy, floodplain mask.

C) Soils & fertility:

Procedural assignment correlated with elevation, slope, distance‑to‑coast, and river proximity. Outputs: fertility index, drainage class.

D) Vegetation (forest cover):

Age‑structured forest map (per cell: age, species bucket). Rules for regrowth, clearing costs, timber yield.

E) Climate/seasonality (lightweight):

4 seasons toggling: field productivity multipliers, fordability penalties, storm risk.

Data structures:

Raster grids: height, fertility, forest age, moisture.

Vector sets: coastline polyline(s), river polylines, waterbodies polygons.

Acceptance criteria:

With default knobs, rivers reach the sea, no infinite sinks.

Coastal plain & ridge belt visibly distinct.

Flow accumulation ranks rivers into a reasonable trunk/tributary hierarchy.

3) Cadastral layer (Parcels & ownership)

Purpose: Represent claimed land as polygons; support irregular metes‑and‑bounds style parcels that hug rivers/roads and use bearings.

A) DCEL/half‑edge overlay:

Independent planar graph storing parcel polygons.

Parcel edges may snap to: river polylines, road polylines, or straight‑line bearings from survey points.

Maintain topological validity (no gaps/overlaps beyond tolerance).

B) Parcel generation:

Anchors: river bends, road junctions, coast, survey stones/trees.

Algorithm: from an anchor, step through a sequence of bearing + distance segments with constraints:

Stop at natural boundaries (river/road/coast).

Constrain area to target (e.g., 50–200 acres param).

Snap to nearby parcel corners; avoid self‑intersection.

Early parcels prefer water frontage; later parcels prefer road frontage.

C) Ownership & tenure:

Parcel → owner id; tenure (freehold/lease/patent).

Land‑use per parcel (forest, field, pasture, manufactory, town lots).

Acceptance criteria:

In a test seed, generate 100–1,000 parcels without topological errors.

Parcels near rivers are long/narrow; inland parcels more compact.

4) Network layer (movement & infrastructure)

A) Nodes & edges:

Nodes: settlement centers, river crossings (fords/bridges/ferries), port docks, key intersections, mills at falls.

Edges: tracks/roads/turnpikes with quality class & width; water routes (coastwise, riverine) optional.

B) Costs & pathfinding:

Edge cost = base surface cost × slope factor × land‑cover factor + crossing penalties + tolls.

A* or Contraction Hierarchies / HPA* for performance on growing graphs.

Seasonal modifiers (mud/snow) if enabled.

C) Desire‑line growth:

Sim sends trips between origin–destination pairs (people, goods).

Accumulate usage on traversed edges; once usage crosses thresholds:

trail → road → turnpike (quality upgrades).

open ferries; later, build bridges at best crossing candidates.

D) Crossings:

Detect candidate crossings where channel is narrow & banks stable; cost model uses span length, flood risk, local materials.

Ferries before bridges if traffic is moderate.

Acceptance criteria:

Given fixed OD pairs, roads self‑form along near‑optimal corridors.

Bridges appear first at narrowings with sustained traffic.

5) Settlements & urbanization

A) Settlement entity:

Fields: population, services (market, blacksmith, mill), industries, port status, centrality metrics.

Rank thresholds: hamlet → village → town → city (unlock buildings & grid types).

B) Seeding:

Initial seeds at sheltered harbors or river mouths (you’ll provide from a harbor scorer).

Secondary seeds at fall‑line (head‑of‑navigation) and major crossroads.

C) Urban growth:

Attractiveness score combines: market access (shortest travel time), harbor quality, flat land, resource pull, governance presence.

Population update each tick; when threshold crossed, lay out streets:

Early organic streets follow terrain & parcel edges.

Later grids snap to a local bearing; preserve diagonal desire lines.

Acceptance criteria:

Towns cluster at harbors & fall‑line nodes; streets densify with growth.

Street graphs remain connected and avoid pathological overlaps.

6) Economy, land use & resources

A) Goods & chains (data‑driven):

Minimal set: food (grain), timber, lumber, charcoal, iron goods, textiles, bricks, tools.

Define recipes: inputs → outputs (+ labor, water power).

B) Agriculture model:

Parcel fields: fertility, acreage, labor; yields per crop; fallow rotation (simple).

Surplus becomes tradable goods; deficits trigger imports/migration.

C) Forestry:

Clearing a parcel converts forest to fields/pasture; yields timber.

Forest regrowth by age with rainfall/soil modifiers.

D) Industry siting:

Mills at rapids/falls; shipyards near timber + harbor; ironworks where charcoal + bog iron (or abstract ore) + water power coincide.

E) Trade & prices (simple):

Each tick: compute demand (population, industries) and supply (farms, forests, workshops).

Route goods along network to minimize total transport+production cost.

Prices are local and adjust via excess demand/supply (optional if you prefer fixed prices + quantities).

Acceptance criteria:

Goods flow toward ports and towns; shortages form where access is poor.

Industry appears at sites with the needed inputs & power.

7) Agents & governance

A) Agents (lightweight):

Households: decide to claim land, migrate to towns, or work in nearby industries based on wages, land access, travel time.

Enterprises: decide to open mills/shipyards when ROI > threshold.

B) Governance decisions:

Bridge approvals, road maintenance priorities, toll setting.

Administrative boundaries (counties) form around county seats (often near fall‑line crossings); states merge counties by contiguity/identity rules.

Acceptance criteria:

With governance disabled, roads still emerge but fewer bridges.

With governance enabled, key crossings get bridges earlier; tolls alter path choices.

8) Time & simulation loop

Tick size: monthly or seasonal.

Order of operations (per tick):

Seasonal state (if enabled): set travel multipliers, crop phase.

Demography: births, deaths, migration; update settlement populations.

Land decisions: parcels claimed/merged/split; forest clearing & field rotation.

Production: farms, forestry, industries produce goods.

Trade routing: compute OD flows; update edge usage counters.

Network upgrades: apply usage thresholds; open ferries/bridges.

Urbanization: place new streets; upgrade settlement rank & services.

Governance: county/state updates; infrastructure approvals.

Stats logging & autosave (optional).

Acceptance criteria:

No order‑of‑updates dependency causes oscillation (use hysteresis).

Running 1,000 ticks on a medium map completes within target perf budget on baseline hardware.

9) Rendering & cartographic style

A) Map look (2D/2.5D):

Height hachures or shaded relief; coastline with shorelines & estuary tint.

Rivers as tapered strokes; marsh symbols where relevant.

Roads: dashed (tracks), solid (roads), bold (turnpikes).

Parcels: faint tan lines with occasional bearing annotations.

Harbors: anchor/wharf symbols; soundings rings (stylized).

Settlements: dot/circle/square glyphs by rank; labels with halo.

B) Layer system:

Physical (terrain, water) / Cadastral (parcels) / Network (roads & ports) / Administrative (counties/states) / Diagnostics (slope, usage heatmaps).

Time scrubber + play/pause; year readout; speed control.

C) Label engine (basic):

Avoid overlaps using screen‑space quadtree.

Priority by feature rank.

Acceptance criteria:

60 FPS panning/zooming on medium maps.

Layers toggle independently; labels remain legible at multiple scales.

10) Tools & editor

World painter:

Sculpt coastline & ridge lines.

Paint elevation deltas; auto‑reflow rivers.

Place fixed harbors/mills if desired.

Scenario editor:

Place starting settlements; set migration inflow; lock certain parcels or roads.

Adjust technology toggles (bridge tech, turnpikes, canal era if you add it).

Diagnostics:

Overlays: slope, flow accumulation, harbor score, parcel validity, edge usage, centrality heatmap.

Step‑through “why this bridge appeared here” narrative.

Acceptance criteria:

Editing the coast or ridge immediately recomputes hydrology & derived maps without stale artifacts.

Save/load scenarios; diffs are deterministic.

12) Key algorithms (pseudo)

River extraction (from height):

for each cell c:
  dir[c] = steepest_descent_neighbor(c)
  flow[c] = 1 + sum(flow[upstream])  // topological order
river_edges = threshold(flow > Fmin)
polyline = follow dir until sea or lake


Harbor score (for coastal points):

H(p) = w1*shelter_curvature(p) + w2*nearshore_depth(p)
     - w3*exposure_to_open_sea(p) - w4*siltation_risk_from_river(p)
place port seeds at local maxima of H over coastal neighborhood


Parcel growth (metes‑and‑bounds):

start = choose_anchor()
poly = [start]
while area(poly) < target and steps < max:
  θ = choose_bearing_biased_toward_frontage()
  L = sample_length_within_bounds()
  q = project(poly.last, θ, L)
  q = snap_to_nearby(road|river|parcel_corner, eps)
  if valid_segment(poly.last->q) then poly.append(q)
close_to_boundary_or_back_to_start()
register_parcel(poly)


Desire‑line road growth & upgrade:

for each OD pair (o,d) with demand w:
  path = A*(o,d; cost)
  for edge in path: edge.usage += w

for edge in edges:
  if edge.cls=='trail' and edge.usage > U1: promote to 'road'
  if edge.cls=='road'  and edge.usage > U2: promote to 'turnpike'
  apply hysteresis to avoid flip-flop


Bridge decision:

for each river crossing candidate x:
  crossing_cost = f(span_length(x), flood_risk(x), foundation_difficulty(x))
  traffic = rolling_annual_traffic_between_banks(x)
  if traffic > crossing_cost * material_availability_factor:
      build_bridge(x)
  else if traffic > ferry_threshold and not has_ferry(x):
      open_ferry(x)


Urban growth & streets:

for each settlement s:
  A = market_access(s) * harbor_bonus(s) * flatland_factor(s) * services_bonus(s)
  ΔP = growth(A, food_surplus_nearby)
  s.pop += ΔP
  if s.pop crosses rank_threshold: unlock service/industry
  lay_or_extend_streets_along(dominant_flow_vectors_near_s)

13) Configuration (data‑driven knobs)

Terrain: plain_width, ridge_orientation_deg, noise_seed, river_density.

Harbors: shelter_weight, exposure_weight, min_spacing_km.

Parcels: target_area_range, frontage_bias, road_vs_river_bias_over_time.

Network: base_costs (trail/road), slope_penalty_curve, seasonal_multipliers, upgrade_thresholds.

Economy: crop_yields, labor_productivity, recipes, demand_per_capita.

Demography: migration_inflow, birth/death rates, urban_pref.

Governance: bridge_multiplier, toll_policy, county_size_target.

Everything above should be editable without recompiling.

14) Testing & validation

Unit tests:

DCEL operations (no dangling edges; parcel union/intersection robustness).

Hydrology (mass conservation; no flow to higher cells).

Pathfinding (shortest path matches ground truth on small graphs).

Golden seeds:

Store “golden” seeds & expected KPIs (e.g., #bridges after 500 ticks, average travel time coastal↔fall‑line, parcel count near port).

Regression test: any code change must keep KPIs within tolerance.

Emergent pattern checks (visual):

Ports/settlements concentrate at sheltered harbors/river mouths.

Fall‑line belt of towns/mills.

Bridges cluster at narrowings; ferries precede bridges.

Road density highest between major ports and interior towns.

Parcel orientation shifts from water‑frontage to road‑frontage over time.

15) UI/UX essentials

Time controls: play/pause, speed (×1, ×5, ×20), step.

Layers panel: checkboxes; intensity sliders.

Inspect tool: click parcel/edge/settlement to see provenance (“why this formed here”, usage, flows).

Mini‑map & bookmarks.

Screenshot/recording export for time‑lapse GIF/MP4.

Keyboard nav: WASD/arrow pan; Q/E zoom.

Deliverable: trails self‑form; usage heatmap; first ferries.

M4: Settlements & streets — Settlement growth, services, street generation; harbor & fall‑line siting.
Deliverable: towns form in plausible places; street grids emerge.

M5: Economy & resources — Crops, forestry, simple industries; trade routing; prices optional.
Deliverable: goods flow; industries open at viable sites.

M6: Governance & states — Counties, seats, bridge approvals, tolls; states coalesce.
Deliverable: admin map overlays; governance toggles affect outcomes.

M7: Polish — Classical cartography, label engine, export, scenario save/load; performance passes.
Deliverable: playable time‑lapse experience.

18) Assumptions & options you can decide later (but design supports both)

Grid vs. irregular: The plan uses raster + vector overlays. If you later want an all‑irregular mesh, you can replace the raster with a planar graph while keeping the same parcel/network abstractions.

Price system: Start with quantity flows only; add prices later if desired.

Water transport: You can add coastal shipping & river navigation as edges in the network (very rewarding visually), or skip in v1.

Historical detail: You can keep it geo‑economic (no wars/politics), or add scenarios & events later.

Indigenous landscapes: If you want to reflect pre‑existing trails and land use, seed initial paths & clearings that shape early colonial choices; the architecture supports it.

19) What “done” looks like

A reproducible seed generates an Atlantic seaboard. Over simulated years, harbors sprout ports; tracks stitch them to inland mills near the fall‑line; ferries appear, then bridges at the busiest narrows; parcels proliferate and gradually reorient from rivers to roads; towns densify into cities; counties/states take shape—all visible on a hand‑drawn‑style map with a scrubber to watch history unfold.

If you want, I can turn this into a starter repo layout (empty modules + interfaces + TODOs) and a minimal spec for each public function so you can begin coding immediately.

Perfect—thanks, Tommi. I’ll lock your choices into a concrete v1 plan and answer the “why economy?” bit in plain terms.

Your choices (locked for v1)

Mode: Watch-only time-lapse; parameters via JSON only (no editor).

Map: 10 × 10 km; a few hundred meters on the east/right are ocean.

Time: Start at “Year 0 of colonization”; quarterly ticks forever.

Flavor: Light historic (fall-line logic, water power, etc.).

Transport: Overland + river navigation + coastal shipping.

Governance: Pure geo-economy (no politics/budgets/edicts).

Industries: Water mills (grist & saw), shipyards, ironworks/charcoal, brickworks, woodworking.

Goals: None (just watch).

Tech: TypeScript + WebGL2 (broadest support); keep the code layout ready for a WebGPU swap later.

Determinism: Strict deterministic seeds.

Export: Animated GIF time-lapse.

“Why economy?” (short answer)

We don’t need money or prices. We just need a driver for why roads/bridges/ports and industries appear. v1 will use a minimal, price-less “activity” model:

The land produces potential activity (fertility, timber, clay, water-power).

People & goods form abstract flows between places; we count flows, not dollars.

Edges with sustained flow upgrade (trail → road → turnpike); narrow river spots with high cross-bank flow get ferries/bridges.

Industries appear when local inputs exist (e.g., timber + falls ⇒ sawmill), not because of profit math.

So: no money, no prices—just geography-driven flows that make infrastructure grow.

Build plan v1 (what to implement)
1) Core & determinism

RNG: xoshiro128** or splitmix64; expose seed in JSON; never use Math.random.

Clock: {year, quarter}; fixed tick order.

Config loader: strict JSON schema + defaulting.

Recorder: capture a frame every N ticks; encode GIF at the end.

2) World generation (10×10 km)

Heightfield (raster): 1024×1024; force a low-slope coastal plain on the east 300–500 m; one inland ridge ribbon; gentle relief.

Hydrology: flow dirs, flow accumulation, river polylines to the coast; small estuary widening near the ocean edge.

Soils/fertility: correlated with elevation, slope, distance-to-river.

Forest: per-cell age (start mature); regrowth after clearing.

Harbor score: along the coastline: shelter curvature + nearshore depth − exposure; pick one best port seed.

3) Transport graph

Nodes: the port; river confluences; fall-line points; later settlements.

Edges (overland): desire-lines from nodes to fertile/forested cells & between settlements; A* on a raster-cost field (slope + land-cover + crossings).

Edges (water):

River nav: downstream edges from fall-line nodes to the sea (blocked above falls).

Coastal shipping: a shoreline polyline with waypoints; cheap but requires a port/landing.

Crossings: precompute good ford/bridge candidates (narrow width + firm banks). Open ferry when cross-bank flow > F₁; upgrade to bridge when > F₂ and span is short enough.

4) Settlements & growth (watch-only)

Seed: the port at harbor max.

Attractiveness: market access (via water/roads), flat land, resource pull.

Population: small growth driven by attractiveness; thresholds spawn hamlet → village → town → (maybe) city.

Streets: organic segments following desire-lines; later, short local grids.

5) Land-use (no parcels in v1)

Raster land-use: Forest | Fields | Pasture | Manufactories | Town.

Claim/clear: cells near settlements/roads with high fertility become fields; logging front advances along roads.

Regrowth: cut forest sets age=0; regrows by climate; drives wood scarcity outward.

6) Industries (iconic, flow-driven)

Mills (grist/saw): at rapids/falls; require river slope + nearby grain/timber activity.

Shipyards: only at port/landing with timber activity.

Ironworks/charcoal: require abundant timber + water-power; optional bog-iron noise mask.

Brickworks: clay mask + water/road access.

Woodworking: near timber & settlements (furniture/carpentry).

Activation rule: each tick compute a simple site score from inputs & access; spawn/upgrade when score crosses a hysteresis threshold; each industry emits flows to/from nearby nodes.

7) Flow & upgrades (no prices)

For each tick:

Create OD “activity bundles”: food to settlements; timber to mills/shipyards; bricks to growing towns; generic passengers.

Route with A* across overland/river/coast edges.

Accumulate edge usage; promote edges by usage; trigger ferries/bridges by cross-bank usage.

8) Rendering (classical map)

Layers: shaded relief; coastline/estuary; rivers (tapered); land-use tint; roads (dashed/solid/bold); settlements glyphs; industry icons.

Time-lapse: fade-in for new edges/buildings; subtle pulse on bridges when completed.

Performance: single WebGL2 draw per layer; instanced symbols for nodes.

9) GIF export

Offscreen canvas at fixed resolution (e.g., 1600×1200).

Capture every k ticks (configurable).

Use a small, browser-friendly GIF encoder (e.g., gifenc or gif.js—one lightweight dependency).

Write to Blob and prompt user download.

Acceptance checks (so you know it’s “working”)

Rivers always reach the ocean; a single port appears at a sheltered cove on the east edge.

Within ~5–20 years, tracks radiate from the port into fertile/forested cells; by usage, some upgrade to roads.

First ferry, then a bridge shows up at the busiest narrow crossing.

Mills appear at fall-line rapids; shipyard appears at the port when timber activity is near; brickworks near clay; ironworks when timber+water power co-locate.

Town glyph grows from hamlet to village as network centrality rises.

The exported GIF shows clear progression without flicker.

Milestones (no editor; params only)

M1 Core/World: RNG + config + 10×10 km worldgen + hydrology + harbor scoring + single port.

M2 Transport: A* routing on raster cost field; overland/river/coastal edges; usage heatmap; ferries/bridges thresholds.

M3 Growth: Land-use raster (fields/forest/pasture/manufactory/town) + settlement growth + street stubs.

M4 Industries: Site scoring + hysteresis + icon placement; hook into flows.

M5 Polish & GIF: Classical rendering, labels, smooth transitions, GIF export; determinism test seeds.

If you want, I can also draft the TypeScript interface file (types.ts) and stub modules (worldgen.ts, transport.ts, growth.ts, render.ts, export_gif.ts) so you can start coding immediately.
